    // CAMERA 
1. Camera moves in same velocity as player, if player hits a wall and is unable to move forward, it still goes on.
2. If player gets stuck and camera passes the player, he dies.


    // FOREGROUND 
1. Ground for the player the walk on will spawn as he moves, and those passed the camera will be destroyed. 
2. they have three varities: normal(green), dark(bluish) and dried(mycellium). (Sprites in Assets/Sprites/Environment)

 

    // BACKGROUNDS 
1. Has five Layers: Closest Ruins(CLOSEST),   Abondened city view,   Far away city view,   Clouds,  Sky(FARTHEST)
2. The background will be part of parallax background
3. Some Objects will also spawn as background(with reduced saturation and value so it reads as a non-interactable to the player's eyes). 
	Example: Small rocks, grasses, broken building parts, etc.



    // OBSTACLES BEHAVIOURS
1. Obstacles will be spawned above the ground, i.e if the ground chunk is large enough to hold object.
2. Obstacles are of two types: Static and Interactable :-
    --STATIC--
	a. includes objects that can be hit only in raged mode, player dies when hitting these in normal or boosted(ignoring boost immunity for one hit)
	b. they vary in sizes: small(16x16), tall(16x32), long(32x16)
	c. will have spaces between, so player actually has chance to jump, and not make it impossible to pass.
    --INTERACTABLES--
	a. basically humans and other entities that can be killed, adds point depending on rarity.
	b. may spawn in groups, doesnt matter unlike static ones, however there will be a spawn limit per chunk, so it wont be too easy to get points by killing them all.
