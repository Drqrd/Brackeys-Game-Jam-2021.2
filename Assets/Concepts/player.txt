  //BASE //
1. Travels in a straight direction, as time goes on, player's velocity increases. 
2. Player can die from hitting obstacles in normal and boosted modes.
3. Player can kill humans in normal and boosted modes, while obstacles can be destroyed only in raged mode.
4. Player floats above the ground by a bit(reduces need for walk animation, no shadows too), and can jump.
5. Player dies only when it hits a obstacle(non human) head on, he can still jump on top of them.




  //STATES
Has Three main Stats: Destroy(Raged), Normal and Boosted:
   1. Normal - Just going forward, can jump 
   2. Boosted - After Certain Amount of distance travelled, boost movement for a while and slows randomly(to make more fast paced situation)
   3. Raged - Destroys Vehicles and everything(Not walls though) that comes in way.

   NOTE: for normal and boosted, they can work on the same script. the "boosted" effect can be shown via animation to make it
